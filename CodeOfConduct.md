# Chainer Code of Conduct

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Chainer.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

Chainer is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at chainer@preferred.jp.
