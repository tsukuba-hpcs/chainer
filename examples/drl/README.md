# Deep Reinforcement Learning Examples

These are minimal examples of writing deep reinforcement learning agents. You need to install [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) before running the examples.

- `dqn.py` implements DQN and DoubleDQN and supports discrete-action tasks.
- `ddpg.py` implements DDPG and supports continuous-action tasks.
