def static_schedule_func(*dec_args, **dec_kwargs):
    """Decorator to mark a function for inclusion in the forward schedule.

    This decorator is used to wrap a function `func` that is a forward-pass
    method of a sub-class of Function. This will cause it to be added to
    the forward static schedule when the `static_graph` feature is
    enabled on a Chain that deeply calls it from the chain's
    `__call__()` method.

    The function to be wrapped should only return `None` because any return value
    will be ignored. Instead of returning its results, any result arrays must
    be supplied as input arguments and must have already have been initialized
    to the appropriate dimensions and data types.

    Usage:

    Typical usage is to allocate any required arrays (Numpy or CuPy) in Python
    code in an instance of FunctionNode (See `LinearFunction` function for an example).
    Generally, this will involve first allocating storage for the results arrays
    in the `forward()` method of a sub-class of Function. Then, the
    FunctionNode.foward()
     method should call another
    (private) method that is wrapped using this decorator. The
    decorated function will take all required input and output arrays as
    arguments and will not return anything (that is, `None` will be implicitly
    returned).

    Note that by following this usage convention, all input and output activations,
    along with any parameter arrays will have been statically allocated by the
    end of the first forward pass. Since the the forward-pass functions that
    are used inside the forward static schedule (that is, the functions that
    use this decorator) do not allocate any results arrays, this results in code that
    looks like 'define-by-run' to the user, and which can be debugged during
    the first iteration, but then becomes static in terms of memory allocations and
    scheduling starting from the second iteration. Thus, we get the benefit of
    both ease of use and optimized performance.

    It is important that all of the required computations that occur during the
    second  and later forward passes must be contained inside the functions
    that use this decorator. That is, any other code (that is not wrapped inside this
    decorator) in the various FunctionNode and Link instances can be viewed as
    setup code that only checks types, allocates result arrays, initializes
    parameters etc., but does not perform any computations that must
    be repeated after the first forward pass.

    The reason for this is that after the first iteration (that is, starting
    from the second forward pass), when the chain's `__call__()` is called,
    the forward static schedule will be invoked and it will only call the
    functions that were wrapped with this decorator. Note that this can potentially
    lead to difficult to find bugs if one forgets to decorate a required function,
    since the corresponding computations would no longer execute after the
    first iteration. As a general rule, any code that is intended to exectue on
    each iteration should be called by a function that uses this decorator.

    Restrictions:

    This feature currently assumes that the inputs to the wrapped function
    Will continue to have the same shapes and types each time it is called.
    There are currently no checks to ensure that this constraint is satisfied.
    Such a type check may be added in the future. For example, the current code
    will break if the mini-batch size changes at any point.
    todo: add checks for this and run the define-by-run code again whenever any
    input sizes change. If such changes are frequent, we can consider caching multiple
    static schedules and using the appropriate one for the current input sizes.

    Args:
        delay_call (bool): Optional keyword argument. If True, don't call the wrapped
        function during the define by run pass, but only add it to the static schedule.
        Default value is False.

        func: A forward-pass method of a sub-class of FunctionNode that will be inserted
            into the static forward schedule when `static_graph` is enabled. The function
            must not return anything because any return values will be ignored.

    Returns: The wrapped function.
