class LinkHook(object):
    """Base class of hooks for Links.

    :class:`~chainer.LinkHook` is a callback object
    that is registered to a :class:`~chainer.Link`.
    Registered link hooks are invoked before calling
    :meth:`forward` methodof each link.

    Link hooks that derive :class:`LinkHook` are required
    to implement two methods:
    :meth:`~chainer.FunctionHook.forward_preprocess` and
    :meth:`~chainer.FunctionHook.forward_postprocess`.
    By default, these methods do nothing.

    Specifically, when :meth:`~chainer.Link.__call__`
    method of some function is invoked,
    :meth:`~chainer.LinkHook.forward_preprocess`
    (resp. :meth:`~chainer.LinkHook.forward_postprocess`)
    of all function hooks registered to this function are called before
    (resp. after) :meth:`forward` method of the link.

    There are two ways to register :class:`~chainer.LinkHook`
    objects to :class:`~chainer.Link` objects.

    First one is to use ``with`` statement. Link hooks hooked
    in this way are registered to all functions within ``with`` statement
    and are unregistered at the end of ``with`` statement.

    .. admonition:: Example

        The following code is a simple example in which
        we measure the elapsed time of a part of forward propagation procedure
        with :class:`~chainer.link_hooks.TimerHook`, which is a subclass of
        :class:`~chainer.LinkHook`.

        >>> from chainer import link_hooks
        >>> class Model(chainer.Chain):
        ...   def __init__(self):
        ...     super(Model, self).__init__()
        ...     with self.init_scope():
        ...       self.l = L.Linear(10, 10)
        ...   def forward(self, x1):
        ...     return F.exp(self.l(x1))
        >>> model1 = Model()
        >>> model2 = Model()
        >>> x = chainer.Variable(np.zeros((1, 10), np.float32))
        >>> with chainer.function_hooks.TimerHook() as m:
        ...   _ = model1(x)
        ...   y = model2(x)
        ...   print("Total time : " + str(m.total_time()))
        ...   model3 = Model()
        ...   z = model3(y) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        Total time : ...

        In this example, we measure the elapsed times for each forward
        propagation of all functions in ``model1`` and ``model2``
        (specifically, :class:`~chainer.functions.LinearFunction` and
        :class:`~chainer.functions.Exp` of ``model1`` and ``model2``).
        Note that ``model3`` is not a target of measurement
        as :class:`~chainer.function_hooks.TimerHook` is unregistered
        before forward propagation of ``model3``.

    .. note::

       Chainer stores the dictionary of registered function hooks
       as a thread local object. So, function hooks registered
       are different depending on threads.

    The other one is to register directly to
    :class:`~chainer.FunctionNode` object with
    :meth:`~chainer.Function.add_hook` method.
    Function hooks registered in this way can be removed by
    :meth:`~chainer.Function.delete_hook` method.
    Contrary to former registration method, function hooks are registered
    only to the function which :meth:`~chainer.FunctionNode.add_hook`
    is called.
